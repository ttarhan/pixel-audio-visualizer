Pixel Audio Visualizer outputs real-time effects based on audio input to sACN/E1.31 compatible light controller(s), often used with WS2811/WS2811b/WS2812 lights. Audio input is analyzed in realtime, and the effect is output at a set framerate (tested to as fast as 50 FPS) to the lights, enabling lightshows that are not pre-sequences in xLights or similar tools. Works well alongside other players by stopping all E1.31 output when audio input ceases. 

More to document. Meantime, config.py is pretty self-explanatory and a good place to start.
